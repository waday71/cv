  <p><em>I am a Solutions Architect and enjoy hiking with my family and learning new technologies. Prior to AWS, I worked
      at Palo Alto Networks as a Cloud Security Engineer supporting their largest customers: PWC, AON, and eBay onboarding and
      scaling their
      Cloud Security SASE (Secure Access Secure Edge) solution. Prior to that I worked at three startups back to back (Cloudgenix - a SD-WAN company, Webscale Networks - a cloud based Application Delivery Controller for e-commerce companies; and MapR
      Technologies (now HPE) a Big Data and
      Analytics data platform). I’ve worked in both pre and post sales roles that included both individual contributor and management positions. I have built Technical Support Organizations, but I enjoy mostly in rolling up my sleeves and getting in
      the trenches with customers and finding thems solutions to achieve their business outcomes.

    <h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.fmsc.org">Feed My Starving Children</a> - Food packet distributor - May 2015</li>
      <p>My family and I donated our time to help "Feed my Starving Children" to assemble food packs for the hungry children around the world. It was a amazing time in a team environment where we competed against other teams of volunteers. I
        would
        recommend this to anyone and everyone, to be a part of and help others.</p>
      <li><a href="https://goo.gl/wZV3fa">Love Your Neighbor Project</a> - Venture Christian Church - May 2016</li>
      <p>I worked with "Love our Neighbor" project through Venture Christian Church in rebuilding a older gentleman's fence who had a stroke. Other projects like painting and water damage restoration, and many more, were done to beautify this
        mans home
        and make it safe for him. Great experience and I would definitely do it again.</p>
